PS002: Design an E-commerce Product Page
Develop a product page for an e-commerce website that effectively showcases a product's features and encourages purchases.

The product page should include:
Product Images: A carousel of high-quality images of the product.
Product Title and Description: A clear and concise title with a detailed description of the product.
Pricing Information: Display the price prominently, including any discounts or offers.
Add to Cart Button: A functional button that adds the product to the shopping cart.
Customer Reviews: A section for customer reviews and ratings.
The page should be designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, ensuring that it provides all necessary information to make an informed purchase decision. Use HTML5 for the structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements such as the image carousel and add-to-cart functionality.
